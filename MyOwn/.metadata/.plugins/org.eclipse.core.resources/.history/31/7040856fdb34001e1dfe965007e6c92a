  I want to verify the login functionality of saucedemo website with diffrent kind of users

  Scenario Outline: Verirfy login fuctionality
    Given user is on saucedemo login page
    When user enters credentials for '<user>' on login page
    Then user should be navigated to 'inventory' page and show error message for locked user

    Examples:
